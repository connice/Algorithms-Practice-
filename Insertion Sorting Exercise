Consider the searching problem:
Input: A sequence of n numbers A D ha1; a2; : : : ; ani and a value .
Output: An index i such that  D AŒi or the special value NIL if  does not
appear in A.
Write pseudocode for linear search, which scans through the sequence, looking
for . Using a loop invariant, prove that your algorithm is correct. Make sure that
your loop invariant fulfills the three necessary properties.




def SERACH (A, v):
    for i = 1 to A.length
       if A[i] == v
            return i
    return NIL
